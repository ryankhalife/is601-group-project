# *UX Research Report: The Study Brew Website Redesign*

## *Objective:*
The objective of this UX research was to assess and improve the design of The Study Brew's website through user testing. Two initial design variants (Design A and Design B) were developed and evaluated using A/B testing, the Think Out Loud protocol, and the 5-second test.

## *Methodology:*
A/B Testing: Participants were shown Design A and Design B and asked which design they preferred and why.
Think Out Loud: Participants interacted with each design while verbalizing their thoughts, actions, and feelings.
5-second Test: Designs were shown to participants for 5 seconds, and they were then asked to recall as much as they could about what they saw.
Participants: Four testing sessions were conducted, with two different participants in each session, totaling eight participants.
